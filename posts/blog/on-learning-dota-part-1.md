# On Learning Dota 2: Introduction

## Backstory
There has been only a few times over the year where I would be invited to play some Dota 2 with friends. This usually means closing Starcraft II, exiting Battlenet, opening Steam, and updating Dota 2 for a couple minutes as I am usually many updates behind. What generally happens next is I hop into a game, with no idea where to play or whom to play and by the 5 minute mark I am so far behind that I have completely lost interest in the game. For the next 30 minutes or however long it takes for us to lose I am spending my time trying to regain interest, or quickly alt tabbing and checking social media or changing music.

This is not an enjoyable experience for myself or my friends and I attributed this mostly to my lack of how this game is played and how I can be valuable to my team. I wanted to learn how to actually play Dota 2.

## Method
Once I decided that it was time to learn how to play this game I needed to figure out how to do this... I started this journey with one thing in mind:

* Make sure I am always playing (or as often as I can bear it) _intentionally_

For me, this means, making sure that I am not getting sucked into the game mindlessly where I play a lot but see little to no improvement. This is what will often plague me when playing other games. To avoid this, I would try and split my time (un-scientifically) between studying the game by watching professional replays, YouTube guides, and my own replays and then playing ranked. I would try and hold myself accountable by continuously asking myself if I am seeing self-improvement and when I don't, reassessing or trying new things.

## Getting Started
At this point in my plan, I had only played a couple games so far and started to take an interest in Position 1. The reason for this selection was a few things:

1. This seemed to be a position I would be able to get _most_ of the time unlike Mid
2. This was a position I felt that I could consistently contribute to my teams wins or losses giving me the most autonomy in my matches
3. I had been playing a couple games of Drow Ranger and really enjoyed playing that hero in my few games that I had played

With all of this prepared, my next step was setting some goals and starting my journey of learning Dota 2 in 2021.
